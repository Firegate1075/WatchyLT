Wifi handling ideas:
Watchy supports the addition of WiFi AP credentials via WiFiManagers credential manager.
Users can select any of the eight saved APs in menu and also start the credential manager to add a new one.
If there are already eight APs saved, the user needs to delete any one of the saved connections to add a new one.

Each connnection entry opens a submenu upon button press where users can select between connecting to or deleting that AP.


MENU 
    -> AP 1
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 2
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 3
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 4
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 5
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 6
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 7
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 8
        -> connect
        -> delete


If fewer than 8 APs are registered, the option to add a new one appears:

MENU 
    -> AP 1
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 2
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 3
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 4
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 5
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 6
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> AP 7
        -> connect
        -> delete
    -> Add AP (starts credential manager)


Adding new credentials:
After saving new credentials in credential manager, esp32 will try to connect to that AP.
Afterwards the new credentials can be read back with WiFiManager.getWiFiSSID(true) and WiFiManager.getWiFiPass(true)

The current AP shall be encapsulated in a CredentialModel object and saved in Controller, from where WiFiHandler will fetch it whenever neccesarry.
